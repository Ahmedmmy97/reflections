How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?
    
	I think it helps very much specially in case of large files that contains a lot
	code but this requires me to save versions periodically.
	
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?	
   
   it make it easy for me to restore a full working project if make any bug that make
   entire project fail and also make me able to trace changes i make to the same file.
   
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
 
   sometimes you forget to commit important changes that may affect project so automatic 
   save here will be helpful , other times automatic save will lead to big file history 
   that make it hard to compare.
